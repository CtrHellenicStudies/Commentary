        <text lang="en">
      Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family 
      designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use 
      the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality
      publications. The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably
      compact, and visually attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence
      in Typeface Design" in two major international typeface design competitions: 
      bukva:raz! (2001), TDC2003 (2003).

      The Gentium Plus font family is based on the original design. It currently 
      comes with regular and italic face only, although additional weights are in
      develoment.

      The goal for this product is to provide a single Unicode-based font family
      that contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
      Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
      orthographic needs, and provide a matching Greek face. In addition, there
      is provision for other characters and symbols useful to linguists. This
      font makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
      typographic issues, such as the need to position arbitrary combinations
      of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.

      Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:

           * Gentium Plus Regular
           * Gentium Plus Italic

      Work is ongoing to provide bold and bold-italic weights, as well as a
      complete book-weight family.

      For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
